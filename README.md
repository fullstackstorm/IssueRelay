# My App

## Setup

1. Install Pipenv if you havenâ€™t already:

   ```bash
   pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv run python src/gui/main_window.py
pipenv run pyinstaller --onefile src/gui/main_window.py

### Summary

- **`Pipenv` does not handle entry points directly**; you manage scripts and entry points using Python scripts and command-line tools.
- **Use `PyInstaller`** for packaging and creating executables.
- **Document your process** in `README.md` for clarity.

By setting up scripts and using `PyInstaller`, you can effectively manage and package your Tkinter application while using `Pipenv` for dependency management.
